My name is Mrigank Bhardwaj, a freshman here at the College of Engineering of UIUC. Iâ€™m interested in engineering obviously, more specifically computers, rockets, planes, and (in general) next-generation transportation technologies. Other interests I have are biking, frisbee, making computer animations, making other kinds of short films, and android app development.

One thing I learned from reading the rules is teams may use no more than six types or sizes of solar cells.
